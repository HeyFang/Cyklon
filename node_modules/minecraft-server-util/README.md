A Node.js library for Minecraft servers that can retrieve status, perform queries, and RCON into servers. It uses modern Minecraft protocols to support the latest servers and also includes backward compatibility for older versions. This library supports both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition servers, as long as the correct method is used.

**Deprecation Notice**

This library has been deprecated, meaning it is no longer actively maintained. While you can still use it, it is highly recommend that you do not as it may be removed from the npm registry in the far future. I have dedicated my time to an alternative service &mdash; [mcstatus.io](https://mcstatus.io) &mdash; which is more extensively tested, more stable, and contains more features than this library.
